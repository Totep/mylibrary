# mylibrary

myLibrary is an application build for the organization of my collection of books. I have a lot of books. Like, a whole lot. An amount that has forced me to call my wife (if she is at home and I'm at a bookstore) and ask her to look over my shelves to see if a have a specific book or not. She's a saint and will do this for me, but it doesn't make me feel any less absurd.
myLibrary is a MEAN stack application with a heavy emphasis on the Mongo Database and Angular. I can input information about a book through the form and it will save to the databast. I can also search my library and it will live display the search results. This way if I am looking for more than one book by the same author it will display all books by Cormac McCarthy that I own. I can also search for all books that match genre results (this actually works more like keywords) so that I can get back all books that match, "Post-Modernism," or, "Horror," or even seaching both of those together, which would dispaly House of Leaves.

I also have plans for implementing a third-party book api so that I can seach an ISBN though their database and save it into my own. This part is not yet complete.
